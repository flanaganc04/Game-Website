Here is my first github project.
This is a public project that anyone can work on or add to
Feel free to add games, improve the UI, or any other improvements you can think of
After some time and learning I realized that this page cannot be my github pages site, so I guess it can just be a repo to hold the wesbite. I will provide a way to use it in vscode.
