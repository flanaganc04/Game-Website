Here is my first github project.
This is a public project that anyone can work on or add to
Feel free to add games, improve the UI, or any other improvements you can think of
After some time and learning I realized that this page cannot be my github pages site, so I guess it can just be a repo to hold the wesbite while I work on it. 

I will provide a way to use it in vscode. To edit and preview html files without paying for a domain, use this extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
Next steps are to create an independent Github Pages site for this page to live independently while I use this repo to check for glitches, bugs, and check commits prior to the other.

Good luck trying to play that shitty unity FPS in browser on a laptop btw.
